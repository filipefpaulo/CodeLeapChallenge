# CodeLeap Challenge

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to CodeLeap for the opportunity to take this technical test and showcase my frontend skills. I would also like to say that the test is quite interesting and can be completed relatively quickly, usually in 3 days, average .

To demonstrate my abilities, I made the decision to use challenging and market-relevant tools. Additionally, I strived to adhere to best practices for code reusability and cleanliness.

I attempted to incorporate some extra features, but I found myself torn between delivering the project quickly and ensuring it was as polished as possible to avoid any errors. As a result, I put in balance where I was able to implement most of the requested differentiators in the challenge. I successfully maintained the complete fidelity of the project with the Figma design (pixel-perfect), and I was able to make it responsive with minimal lines of code. Furthermore, I implemented pagination solutions for the posts.

Again, I would like to express my gratitude to the team at CodeLeap, and I want to emphasize that I am fully available via email or LinkedIn for any questions that may arise, whether they are related to the project or my skills.
